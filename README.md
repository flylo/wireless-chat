#### TODO
- Transmit from input (use Serial in from laptop until keyboard arrives)
- Encryption using random key
    - on boot, radio transmits a random key
    - if another radio ACKs, then that is the decryption key for all comms
    - if no other radio ACKs, then wait for a key
- Default mode is to receive
- Sliding LCD for longer messages
- Keyboard integration
- Editable text input
- Piezo Speaker integration
